## History of the US Census {.smaller}
::: {.fragment}

Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states:

>“The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct." ^[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/census-constitution.html]
:::

::: {.fragment}
The decennial census began in August 2, 1790, under the supervision of the Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson.

U.S. Marshalls conduct the first census, which was little more than a count of our population, which asks six questions:

## History of the US Census {.smaller}

. . . 

By the turn of the century, the demographic, agricultural, and economic segments of the decennial census collected information on hundreds of topics. 

. . .

Recognizing the growing complexity of the decennial census, Congress created a permanent Census Office within the Department of the Interior on March 6, 1902. 

. . .

On July 1, 1902, the U.S. Census Bureau officially "opened its doors".

## Innovations {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Herman Hollerith, a U.S. Census Bureau employee during the 1880 census, revolutionized a means of coding and tallying information for the 1890 census, using punch cards.

::: {.fragment}
Hollerith formed the Tabulating Machine Company, which later became part of what is now International Business Machines, or IBM Corporation.

The Electronic Numeric Integrator and Computer or ENIAC was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, used by the War Department's Ballistic Research Laboratory. ^[https://www.census.gov/history/www/innovations/technology/univac_i.html]

::: {.fragment}
During the ENIAC project, the lead engineer on the ENIAC met with several Census Bureau officials to discuss non-military applications for electronic computing devices. The final result were specifications for the Universal Automatic Computer, or UNIVAC.

## Finding Census Data {.smaller}

Begin with a research question.

> "What is the education attainment in my community"? 
 
. . .

There are three questions to consider:

::: {.incremental}
1. What data [topics]{style="color:#205493;"} are covered by the various surveys?
2. [Where]{style="color:#205493;"} does the data come from?
3. What [geographies]{style="color:#205493;"} does the Census Bureau publish data for?
:::


## What [topics]{style="color:#205493;"} are covered by the various surveys? {.smaller}


The Census Bureau measures the economy, people, and places. The Bureau publishes 
statistics on many topics:

::: {.incremental}
- **Demographic**: Sex, Age, Race, Hispanic Origin, Housing Units
- **Social**: Education, Marital Status, Fertility, Grandparents
- **Housing**: Occupancy, Housing Value & Costs, Utilities
- **Economic**: Income & Poverty, Employment, Occupation, Industry
:::

> "What is the [education]{style="color:#205493;"} attainment in my community"? 
:::
 
## [Where]{style="color:#205493;"} does the data come from? {.smaller}

. . .

There are over 130 surveys and censuses.

. . .

Data is published at different times, in different frequencies, and for different geographies. 

Some are published monthly, some yearly, and even once every ten years, as is the case with the decennial census. 


## [Where]{style="color:#205493;"} does the data come from? {.smaller}

If your community is below [65,000]{style="color:#205493;"}, you need the 5 year ACS estimates. If it is [65,000]{style="color:#205493;"} or greater, you can select either the 1 year or 5 year estimates.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Household survey conducted by the Census Bureau that samples about 3 1/2 million addresses each year.

- Fully implemented in 2005, arising for a need to collect social, economic, and housing data continuously through the decade.

- ACS is based on a sample of the population, whereas the Decennial Census is a count of the population.

- There are 40-plus topics available in the ACS include: demographic data, commuting, employment income, housing costs, fertility, and more.

Simplified API Interfaces exist in the programming languages R and Python:

- `tidycensus` is an R package that allows users to interface with a select number of the US Census Bureau’s data APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames, optionally with simple feature geometry included.

- `census` is a Python package that provides access to ACS and Summary File 1 data sets.
