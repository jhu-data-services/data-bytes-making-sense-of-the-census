### Learning
To learn more about the US Census Bureau, available censuses and surveys, and how to work with Census data, please visit [Census Academy: Your Learning Hub for Data Skills](https://www.census.gov/data/academy.html){target="_blank"}.

### Available Surveys

**[Census Survey Explorer](https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools/survey-explorer/){target="_blank"}**: Use the [Census Survey Explorer](https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools/survey-explorer/) to discover U.S. Census Bureau surveys and censuses by filtering and searching by geography, frequency, topics, and subtopics. 

**[List of Surveys](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/surveyhelp/list-of-surveys.html){target="_blank"}**: An alphabetical list of all Census Bureau surveys.

### Accessing Census Data 

**[QuickFacts](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/){target="_blank"}**: QuickFacts provides statistics for all states, counties, and cities and towns with a population of 5,000 or more.

**[data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/){target="_blank"}**:
Your primary source for accessing census data. 

  - **Searching data.census.gov**: There are two ways to search [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov). Search using the natural language search, formulating your search in the format:

    `topic` in `geography` in `year`

    For example, if I wanted to find data on commuting in Baltimore in      2017, I would use the query: `commute` in `Baltimore City` in `2017`. 
    
    If you are not successful, you can use the [advanced search](https://data.census.gov/advanced) to manually specify your search filters.

### Accessing Census Microdata

**Modern**: Access microdata from the American Community Survey using the [Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html){target="_blank"} files. 

**Historical**: Decennial census records older than 72 years are released through the National Archives: [archives.gov/research/census](https://www.archives.gov/research/census){target="_blank"}.
